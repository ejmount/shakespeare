Shakespeare is a pure Rust framework that focuses on ergonomics and extensibility in its implementation of the [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) for creating highly parallel yet safe and robust systems. Actors are run as tasks directly on top of [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) (with no "world" or "system" boundary) and run fully in parallel.

**Why do I want an actor system?** - The actor model has many of the same architectural benefits as micro-services bring to complex systems, but on a smaller scale and with less overhead. (Namely, that no serialization is needed for actors on the same host.)

It is ideal for problems that decompose into separate tasks ("actors") that can be executed asyncronously, but where each task has state associated with it and access to that state must be coordinated. This coordination is then achieved by the actors passing messages to each other. Examples of this situation include messaging protocols like IRC and Matrix, distributed services like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm (and anything else using Raft consensus), and even some styles of video games. More specifically, the actor model means:

* Concurrency and scheduling policy fade into the background to leave the application logic more prominent, which can then be designed as it would be on a single-threaded system - any particular operation never needs to take locks on values it doesn't already own.
* Actors' interfaces - and so allowed operations on the data - are declared explicitly rather than allowing a holder of a lock to make arbitrary changes to the shared value.
  * Actors being the unique owners of their data also avoids all issues that would necessitate a lock hierachy.
* Parallel execution falls out "for free" once the data model is designed

**Why do I want *Shakespeare*?** - Shakespeare focuses on generality that allows the progarmmer to express their intent while preserving runtime performance, even if this may leave it with a higher barrier to entry than its alternatives. Its most significant features include:

* **Polymorphic actors** - actors' interfaces ("roles") are a first-class consideration in Shakespeare, and ergonomically allowing an actor to have multiple roles, and a role to have multiple implementations, were important considerations. Allowing code to work with dynamically chosen actors of a given role is a primary use case, enabling not only polymorphism within application code but also allowing mocking in integration testing and the like.
  * While this is achievable using a `Arc<Mutex<Queue>>` containing an enum, Shakespeare generates all of the glue to do so automatically.
  * If a role is exported publicly, downstream crates can implement it on their own actors exactly as with normal traits.
* **Rich interfaces** - a single role for an actor can support any number of messages and accompanying methods with no more boilerplate than the equivalent trait definition. Messages can include any number of input parameters of any type. This includes methods that return values, with the choice of whether or not to wait for the response remaining with the caller and being made on a call-by-call basis.
  * There is [special support](https://docs.rs/shakespeare/latest/shakespeare/fn.send_reply_to.html) for relaying the returned value onwards without waiting for the remote processing to complete.
* **Static validation** - Shakespeare attempts to validate as much as possible at compile time - actors are strongly typed throughought, and the library emphasizes expressing functions' preconditions through the type system. The output of Shakespeare's macros is similarly statically-typed throughout, minimizing runtime overhead and offering more visibility to the optimizer. Sending a message to and then awaiting the response from an actor of statically known type incurs *no* virtual function calls.
* **Interoperability** - linking actors into the wider ecosystem of async code is designed to be easy - actor messages implement `Future`, and actors can treat [`Future`](https://docs.rs/shakespeare/latest/shakespeare/fn.send_future_to.html) and `Stream` objects as incoming messages with no indirection.
  * Conversely, message handlers within an actor can be `async` and can await arbitrary Futures, with actor messages simply being a special case.
* **Recovery** - Shakespeare makes it easy to respond an actor stopping its processing, both by providing a cleanup hooks within the actor and providing a `Future` to the caller (that originally created the actor) that will become ready when the spawned actor stops.
  * Both the cleanup handling and the value from the cleanup `Future` indicate whether the shutdown was graceful (i.e. all references to the actor were dropped) or was a result of a panic within a message handler, so that error handling is more easily separated from the "happy path."
  * Recovery handling is entirely optional - the cleanup `Future` can simply be dropped with no ill effect.  (Note in this case, the actor panicking will *not* propagate up)

For a full explanation of how all this works, see [the crate documentation](https://docs.rs/shakespeare/latest/).

It is worth noting that Shakespeare currently does **not** offer any built-in support for:

* Global/static "broadcasts" of any kind - actors only have access to their own state and any static values your application code has defined.
* Networking - while actor messages conceptually have the same semantics as remote procedure calls, Shakespeare currently only supports messages within a single host process.

However, these capabilities are expected to be relatively straightforward to build in application code - one of the original imagined use cases involved "proxy" actors that implement a Role by forwarding the received messages to an actor on a remote host. If covering these use cases is important to you, please raise an issue and leave your feedback.

Additionally, Shakespeare currently runs exclusively on [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) but this may change in the future. It also currently uses only unbounded channels, but improving this is planned future work.

## Example

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use shakespeare::{actor, performance, role};
use tokio::sync::mpsc;

#[role]
trait BasicRole {
    fn inform(&mut self, val: usize);
    fn get(&self) -> usize;
}

#[actor]
mod AnActor {
    struct StateA(mpsc::Sender<usize>);

    #[performance]
    impl BasicRole for StateA {
        async fn inform(&mut self, val: usize) {
            self.0.send(val).await;
        }
        fn get(&self) -> usize {
            42
        }
    }
}


#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let (tx, mut rx) = mpsc::channel(1);

    let actor_state = StateA(tx);
    let actor: Arc<dyn BasicRole> = AnActor::start(actor_state).actor_handle; // Actors can be upcast to a Role trait object

    {
        let _ = actor.inform(100);
        // can let the value drop to fire and forget, ignoring any return value from the actor
    }
    let chan_response = rx.recv().await;
    assert_eq!(chan_response, Some(100));

    let ret_value = actor.get().await; // But can also await to get a syncronous, strongly-typed return value

    assert_eq!(ret_value, Ok(42));
}
```

## Compatibility

If you directly browse this crate's source code, you will come across functions marked `pub` but also `#[doc(hidden)]`. This is because the macros used in Shakespeare generate output code that then calls into these library functions. These calls technically originate from the *user's* crate, which means the called functions need to be `pub` to resolve. However, they are nonetheless not intended for direct client use, so they are suppressed from the documentation and **are exempt from SemVer** - code calling these functions by bypassing documented interfaces may break even in patch releases.
