//!
//! Shakespeare is an [actor system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) focused on rich interfaces and polymorphism without impacting runtime performance.
//!
//! Shakespeare is based around three concepts:
//! * [Actors](`shakespeare_macro::actor`) - objects that can asynchronously receive messages and run user-defined code in response. Actors contain state of an arbitrary type; message handlers can be arbitrary code, although will most commonly include updating their state, sending new messages and/or spawning additional actors.
//!    * Some parts of this documentation refer specifically to the "actor shell", which is the automatically generated proxy object that handles the message passing into and out of the code you have written defining the actor's methods and state.
//!    * There is no "world" or "system" boundary in Shakespeare - any part of your program can call methods on any actor for which it has a handle, and any part can spawn new actors.
//! * [Roles](`shakespeare_macro::role`) - traits for actors. A Role defines a set of methods that can be asynchronously called on an actor and which may be asynchronous themselves. These methods return a [`Envelope`] which is a `Future` of a return value, if any - the caller can use the envelope object to decide whether (and how) to await for any return value that the method may produce.
//! * [Performances](`shakespeare_macro::performance`) - the block of code that actually defines how a given actor implements a role. This is in most ways a normal trait implementation, with the macro generating all of the glue code needed to call the defined methods as part of the actor's message loop.
//!
//! ## Using actors
//!
//! With a tokio runtime running, (e.g. via `#[tokio::main]`) an actor instance is created by calling the `start` function on the actor's shell type, which consumes a value of the corresponding state type. The `start` function is currently defined in a way that means it is private and a sibling of the `#[actor]` module - if you want to expose it more widely (including outside of the crate, i.e. `pub`) you will have to define a wrapper function for now. This requirement may be relaxed in a future version.
//!
//! The `start` function returns a [`ActorHandles`], which contains two values:
//! * an [`ExitHandle`] - this is a [`Future`][`std::future::Future`] that yields when the actor exits, the value of which indicates whether the actor exited gracefully (all handles were dropped or a handler explicitly shut it down) or by one of the message handlers panicking. Dropping this value doesn't affect the actor's execution
//! * the `message_handle` - an [`Arc`][`std::sync::Arc`] containing the shell type, the first handle to the new actor. If all `Arcs` of the actor drop, the actor begins shutting down.
//!
//! At this point, the actor is active as a separate task, and will process any messages sent to its mailbox by calling the appropriate method from the corresponding performance definition.
//!
//! To send the actor a message, methods defined by the actor's roles can be called on the shell as normal, except that where the role defines a method with signature `... -> T` the call on the shell type instead returns [`Envelope<T>`]. For full details, see that type's documentation, but in most cases, you will want to do one of two things with it:
//! * `await` it - an `Envelope` implements [`IntoFuture`][`std::future::IntoFuture`] and will yield a value of `Ok(T)` assuming there are no problems with data transfer to the actor.
//! * allow it to drop, which will dispatch the message to the destination actor's mailbox but not wait for any return value.
//!
//! Actors can also receive general [`Future`] and [`Stream`][`futures::Stream`] values to their mailboxes, using [`Message::send_to`] and [`MessageStream::send_to`]. The types these functions can work on are specified by what implementations of the [`Accepts`] trait the actor has, see that trait documentation for details.
//!
//! **Note**: The API is designed to allow code to work with dynamically typed actors of a given role by using values of type `Arc<dyn Role>`, which `Arc<A>` can be upcast to by normal language rules. This construction does mean that the compiler may need help to correctly disambiguate [`Message::send_to`] (and similar) calls.
//!
//!
//! ## Defining an actor
//!
//! The starting point for defining a new actor is an `#[actor]` module block. The name of the actor shell type (from which `start` is called) is defined by the name of the module. As an example, to start the following, one would call `MyActor::start(SomeState)`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[actor]
//! mod MyActor {
//! 	enum SomeState {
//! 		Some(Data),
//! 		Empty,
//! 	}
//! 	// ...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The module needs to contain exactly one `struct`, `enum` *or* `union`, which serves as the state type of the actor. This type must be `'static`, `Sized`, and cannot contain free generic parameters (`enum SomeState<T>` would not be allowed) but there are no other restrictions on its content. It does not move after the actor is started, so storing large amounts of data inline is not a performance concern.
//!
//! ### Performances
//!
//! The module must also contain at least one `#[performance]` trait impl block:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[performance]
//! impl ARole for MyActor {
//!     async fn a_method(&mut self, ...) -> ... {
//!         todo!()
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! While inherent `impl SomeState` blocks are allowed within the module, there is currently no support for calling these from outside the actor - all externally callable methods must be defined on a performance. (See `canonical` performances later for a simplification of the common case)
//!
//! For methods inside a performance block, `Self` refers to the state type. (e.g. `SomeState` above) The above is the "strongest" form of signature - method implementations that do not `await` anything or mutate the state object do not have to include the respective keywords.
//!
//! **N.B.** While an actor's message handler can `await` futures (whether from an [`Envelope`] or otherwise) the event loop cannot resume until the method returns. This risks deadlocks where two actors end up awaiting replies from each other. If you need to handle the return value from calling another actor without blocking the original sender by waiting on it, consider using [`Message::send_to`] or [`MessageStream::send_to`] and passing the sender's handle.
//!
//! A performance implementation is allowed to be outside of the actor `mod` scope, in the same way that any other `impl ... for` block can be anywhere within the crate, but if it is elsewhere, the `mod` must contain a `#[performance] impl ARole for MyActor {}` block, including empty braces. A more detailed description along with other caveats can be found in [the full macro documentation](shakespeare_macro::performance).
//!
//! Defining a role is syntatically a normal trait declaration with the appropriate macro attached:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[role]
//! trait ARole {
//!     fn a_method(&mut self, ...) -> ...;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The methods on this trait should *not* be marked `async`, that is handled by the macro. Additionally, there are a number of restrictions on the trait's methods - see the [the macro documentation](shakespeare_macro::role) for the specifics.
//!
//! It's expected that many traits have a single "primary" implementation, such as an application object having a particular interface that testing mock implementations conform to. To simplify this situation, instead a role can be defined implicitly via a performance by providing:
//! ```ignore
//! #[performance(canonical)]
//! impl ARole for MyActor {
//!     ... // the trait ARole will be defined as part of generating the performance
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Miscellenia
//!
//! A method inside a performance can define its *second* parameter (i.e. the one immediately after the `self`) as having a type of `&'_ mut Context<Self>` to get access to the [`Context`] object for the current actor, which includes the capability of getting the current actor's handle or shutting it down early.  The context parameter should *not* be included in any explicitly defined roles, and roles defined by `canonical` performances take this into account.
//!
//!
//! ## Actor Lifetime
//!
//! There are several events in the actor's lifecycle that are accessed by optionally defining freestanding (i.e. outside of any `impl`) functions within the `#[actor]` module. Their names, inputs and events are:
//!
//! * `stop(self)` - is called with the final value of the actor's state object when the actor shuts down without panicking
//!	* `catch(self, Box<dyn Any + Send>)` - called in the event a method handler panics, being provided the final state value and the value passed to the `panic!` call
//!
//! Both of these functions can have any `'static + Sized` return type, and any return values from these functions will be passed back to the [`ExitHandle`].
//!
//! **N.B.**: The `catch` function is not technically running in an unwinding context, so a secondary panic will not abort the process. However, Shakespeare leaves behaviour in the event of panic within `catch` unspecified except that safety is upheld, and **the exact behaviour may change even in patch releases**.
//!
//!
//! ### Start
//!
//! Calling `Actor::start(state)` spawns a new task for handling the actor's event loop. It is expected that you do any setup needed for the actor to be in a ready state in the construction of the `state` value itself, and there is currently no interface for running user code after the actor is constructed but before the event loop proper begins. However, while the event loop has technically started by the time that `start` returns, the only way to provide messages to process is via the handle coming out of `start` - there is no global broadcasting that might pre-empt this. This means that if a "guaranteed first call" is needed, this can be achieved by simply sending a message and waiting for a response before sharing the handle.
//!
//! Once the event loop is established, it awaits a message indicating a call made against the shell, via any of the roles the actor might have, and then calls the appropriate method from the corresponding `performance` for any it receives.
//!
//! ### Synchronisation
//!
//! The order the actor responds to calls from different tasks is unspecified. The order the actor responds to calls made via two different roles is unspecified *even from the same task or from the same handle.* A call will *happen-before* another call if the second call is made via a method defined by the same role, and from the same task, as the first call. Calls made by an actor's own performances count as being made on the same task as each other.
//!
//!
//! ### Shutting down
//!
//! The actor can stop processing messages and shut down in several circumstances:
//!
//! 1. If a message handler panics, `catch` is called (or the panic value passed straight up to the [`ExitHandle`] if there is no `catch`) immediately. No further messages are processed, and attempting to send messages to the actor will fail by returning `Err` to the caller.
//! 2. If the [`Context::stop`] is called, no further messages are processed, calls against the actor will return `Err`, but the actor's `stop` function is called rather than `catch`. This similarly passes the returned value up to the [`ExitHandle`].
//! 3. If the `Arc` that was returned from `start` and all of its copies drop, *and* no further messages are waiting to be processed, `stop` will be called as in case 2. By definition, it is not possible for an external client to be sending messages to the actor at this point. (Note that functions directly subscribing the actor to a future result, such as [`MessageStream::send_to`] implicitly hold an `Arc` and will preclude this case until that value yields to exhaustion.)
//!
//! **N.B:** Because method implementations can get hold of the actor's own handle via the [`Context`], then even if all other copies have dropped at any given time, a running event handler can "save" the actor by sending a new copy of the handle out of the actor. This is not treated as the actor being revived from having shut down, but instead it has not shut down in the first place.
//!
//! As an implementation detail of making all of the above work, *every actor* has a watchdog timer that fires intermittently to check for case 3 above, *whether or not* handles to the actor remain live. As a result, there is both a marginal amount of CPU use even by idle actors, and also a finite "finalization" interval between processing stopping (i.e. the later of the last handle dropping and the last message handler completing) and the actor beginning to shut down by calling `stop`. The exact length and behaviour of this watchdog **is not part of ``SemVer`` compatibility**, and the behaviour may vary in future versions. Currently, this timer goes off 1 second (1000ms) after the last message was received, and recurs at the same rate if the actor is still alive at that point. This is considered a design issue and may be removed entirely in future versions.
