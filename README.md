Shakespeare is a framework written in Rust that focuses on ergonomics and extensibility in its implementation of the [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) for creating highly parallel yet safe and robust systems.

Its most significant features include:

* __Polymorphic actors__ - actors' interfaces are a first-class consideration in Shakespeare, and allowing code to work over dynamically chosen actors is a primary use case.
* __Rich interfaces__ - a single interface for an actor can support any number of methods with no more boilerplate than the equivalent trait definition. This includes methods returning values, while the choice of whether or not to wait for the response remains with the caller and can be made on a call-by-call basis.
* __Static validation__ - Shakespeare validates as much as possible at compile time, either by using macros, or expressing functions' preconditions through the type system. The macros similarly aim for statically-typed output, minimizing runtime overhead and offering more visibility to the optimizer.
* __Interoperability__ - linking actors into the wider ecosystem of async code is designed to be easy - actor messages implement `Future`, and actors can interact with  `Future` and `Stream` generically.
* __Recovery__ - an actor shutting down both runs a cleanup function within the actor and sends out a value indicating whether the shutdown was graceful (i.e. all references were dropped) or was a result of a panic within a message handler, along with any return value from the cleanup. Another actor can then subscribe to receive this value like any other `Future`.

Shakespeare currently runs exclusively on tokio but this may change in the future. It also currently uses only unbounded channels and so has no handling of backpressure, but improving this is planned future work.

## Example

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use shakespeare::{actor, performance, role, ActorSpawn};
use tokio::sync::mpsc;

#[role]
trait BasicRole {
    fn inform(&mut self, val: usize);
    fn get(&self) -> usize;
}

#[actor]
mod Actor {
    struct StateA(mpsc::Sender<usize>);
    #[performance]
    impl BasicRole for State {
        async fn inform(&mut self, val: usize) {
            self.0.send(val).await;
        }
        fn get(&self) -> usize {
            42
        }
    }
}


#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let (tx, mut rx) = mpsc::channel(1);

    let actor: Arc<dyn BasicRole> = Actor::start(StateA(tx)).msg_handle;
    {
        actor.inform(100);
        // can let the message drop to fire and forget
    }
    let value = rx.recv().await;
    assert_eq!(value, Some(100));

    let ret_value = actor.get().await; // But also await to get a syncronous return value

    assert_eq!(ret_value, Ok(42));
}
```

## Compatibility

If you directly browse this crate's source code, you will come across functions marked `pub` but also `#[doc(hidden)]`. This is because the macros used in Shakespeare generate output code that then calls into these library functions. These calls technically originate from the *user's* crate, which means the called functions need to be `pub` to resolve. However, they are nonetheless not intended for direct client use, so they are suppressed from the documentation and __are exempt from SemVer__ - code bypassing documented interfaces may break even in patch releases.
